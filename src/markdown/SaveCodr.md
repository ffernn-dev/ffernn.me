I don't remember what state I left this project in (I believe it is feature-complete), but SaveCodr was a little webpage I made to decode/generate save codes for the fun little idle game "[Idle Breakout](https://kodiqi.itch.io/idle-breakout)"
I reverse-engineered the base-64 encoded save string by modifying values and seeing what changed, and I threw together a simple UI to adjust all the different values I could find.
