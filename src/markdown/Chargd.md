**UPDATE OCT 2023: this isn't actively being worked on for the foreseeable future sorry**

I'm working on this with [my friend Bucketfish](https://bucketfish.me/), the plan is for it to be a social media where the 'posts' are only when you charge or unplug your phone. In some small testing it's quite fun and it becomes a tiny little blog e.g. "Just got home from school üòÆ‚Äçüí®" or "oh no forgot to plug in my phone last night!" There's a lot of work to go, but I hope it comes to fruition.
