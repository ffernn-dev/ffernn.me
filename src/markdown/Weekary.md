**Weekary** is a simple weekly planner I made to help me with blocking out the regular weekly events I have to better visualise my time. Some things that I'm proud of are the autosave that waits for you to stop typing before saving, the visual theme, and the popup colour picker. There are some features I would still like to implement, but haven't had the time to yet: 
- Customising the time blocks to allow for things like half-hourly schedules, or custom day start/end times
- Data export/import to move between devices
- Improve the colour picker to allow "painting" i.e. colouring many blocks by clicking and dragging over them.
I loved working on this project and might implement some of the ideas into a more comprehensive calendar solution in the future.

*Thanks Ara for the screenshot of your schedule :)*
