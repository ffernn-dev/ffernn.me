<h2>Original Description</h2>
<p
  >There are three inevitable things in life: death, taxes,
  and <strong>homework</strong>.
  <strong
    >The web version has limited graphics to run better in browsers. Please use
    the desktop builds where possible.</strong
  ><br />You are but a little guy with a deadline. But the world is such a fun
  place! There are various things to do, and homework isn&#39;t
  really <em>that</em> important anyway. Procrastinate as much as you can, but
  watch out for your parents — they will pressure you to do work faster if they
  catch you lazing around. Watch the clock carefully for their arrival! All the
  best, little rebel.</p
