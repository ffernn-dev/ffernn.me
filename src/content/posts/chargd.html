<p><strong>UPDATE OCT 2023: this isn&#39;t actively being worked on for the foreseeable future sorry</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;m working on this with <a class='url inlineurl' href="https://bucketfish.me/" title="">my friend Bucketfish</a>, the plan is for it to be a social media where the &#39;posts&#39; are only when you charge or unplug your phone. In some small testing it&#39;s quite fun and it becomes a tiny little blog e.g. &quot;Just got home from school 😮‍💨&quot; or &quot;oh no forgot to plug in my phone last night!&quot; There&#39;s a lot of work to go, but I hope it comes to fruition.</p>
