  >I&#39;m working on this with
  <a class="url inlineurl" href="https://bucketfish.me/" title=""
    >my friend Bucketfish</a
  >, the plan is for it to be a social media where the &#39;posts&#39; are only
  when you charge or unplug your phone. In some small testing it&#39;s quite fun
  and it becomes a tiny little blog e.g. &quot;Just got home from school
  üòÆ‚Äçüí®&quot; or &quot;oh no forgot to plug in my phone last night!&quot;
  There&#39;s a lot of work to go, but I hope it comes to fruition.</p
