<h2>Update 2024:</h2>
<p
  >This was my first foray into game development using the Godot engine. I&#39;d
  had experience making small scratch games, but I was teaching myself Godot and
  saw an ad for the Stop Waiting For Godot game jam so decided to try my hand at
  making a game in a weekend. Needless to say it&#39;s not amazing, but I
  learned a lot about object oriented game design, time management and how to
  stay within scope.</p

<h2>Original description:</h2>
<p
  >A very basic platformer for the STOP WAITING FOR GODOT Game jam. It&#39;s
  very lacking at the moment, but this is my first time making a proper game. I
  may or may not build on it in the future, but give me any feedback in the
  comments. <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Dashing upwards is broken so make sure
  to press z <em>before</em> you press jump!<br />I will be making a video of
  the process soon-ish, so keep an eye on my channel:
