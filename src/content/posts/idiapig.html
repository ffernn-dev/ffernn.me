<h2>Update 2024:</h2>
<p>This was my first foray into game development using the Godot engine. I&#39;d had experience making small scratch games, but I was teaching myself Godot and saw an ad for the Stop Waiting For Godot game jam so decided to try my hand at making a game in a weekend. Needless to say it&#39;s not amazing, but I learned a lot about object oriented game design, time management and how to stay within scope.</p>
<h2>Original description:</h2>
<p>A very basic platformer for the STOP WAITING FOR GODOT Game jam. It&#39;s very lacking at the moment, but this is my first time making a proper game. I may or may not build on it in the future, but give me any feedback in the comments.
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Dashing upwards is broken so make sure to press z <em>before</em> you press jump!<br>I will be making a video of the process soon-ish, so keep an eye on my channel:

<p>Thanks! &lt;3</p>
