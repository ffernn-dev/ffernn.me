<p
  ><strong>Weekary</strong> is a simple weekly planner I made to help me with
  blocking out the regular weekly events I have to better visualise my time.
  Some things that I&#39;m proud of are the autosave that waits for you to stop
  typing before saving, the visual theme, and the popup colour picker. There are
  some features I would still like to implement, but haven&#39;t had the time to
  yet:
</p>
<ul>
  <li
    >Customising the time blocks to allow for things like half-hourly schedules,
    or custom day start/end times</li
  >
  <li>Data export/import to move between devices</li>
  <li
    >Improve the colour picker to allow &quot;painting&quot; i.e. colouring many
    blocks by clicking and dragging over them. I loved working on this project
    and might implement some of the ideas into a more comprehensive calendar
    solution in the future.</li
