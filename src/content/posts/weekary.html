<p><strong>Weekary</strong> is a simple weekly planner I made to help me with blocking out the regular weekly events I have to better visualise my time. Some things that I&#39;m proud of are the autosave that waits for you to stop typing before saving, the visual theme, and the popup colour picker. There are some features I would still like to implement, but haven&#39;t had the time to yet: </p>
<ul>
<li>Customising the time blocks to allow for things like half-hourly schedules, or custom day start/end times</li>
<li>Data export/import to move between devices</li>
<li>Improve the colour picker to allow &quot;painting&quot; i.e. colouring many blocks by clicking and dragging over them.
I loved working on this project and might implement some of the ideas into a more comprehensive calendar solution in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Thanks Ara for the screenshot of your schedule :)</em></p>
